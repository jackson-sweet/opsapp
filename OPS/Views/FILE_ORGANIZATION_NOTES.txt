# File Organization Notes

## Reorganization Overview

We've reorganized the project files to improve maintainability and code organization. The new structure organizes components by their functionality and scope, making it easier to find and work with related files.

## Resolving Build Issues

We encountered a build issue with multiple README.md files being included in the build products. To resolve this, we:

1. Renamed all documentation files from .md to .txt to prevent Xcode from including them in the build.
   - This includes README files, organization plans, and import guidelines.

2. Kept the same organization structure with components grouped by functionality:
   - Common - for shared UI elements
   - Project - for project-related components
   - User - for user-related components
   - Map - for map and location components
   - Images - for image handling components

## No Import Changes Required

Swift projects typically don't require import changes when reorganizing files within the same target. All Swift files in the same target are compiled together into a single module, so they can reference each other without explicit imports.

## Next Steps

After this reorganization, the project should build successfully. The new structure provides logical grouping of components that will make the codebase more maintainable as it continues to grow.
