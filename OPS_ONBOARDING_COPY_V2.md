# OPS ONBOARDING COPY V2
## High-Conversion Rewrite Based on Research & Brand Playbook

**Purpose**: Complete copy replacement for iOS app onboarding flow
**Voice**: 70% Jocko (disciplined, direct) / 30% Peer (practical, field-credible)
**Key Principles Applied**:
- Get users to "Aha Moment" in under 60 seconds
- Show value BEFORE asking for commitment
- Reduce friction at every step
- Use action verbs, not feature descriptions
- Pass the 6 AM Tuesday Test

---

## 1. WELCOME SCREEN

### Current Copy:
- Title: "OPS"
- Tagline: "BUILT BY TRADES," / "FOR TRADES."
- Subtitle: "Designed In The Field, Not In A Tech Office."
- Primary Button: "GET STARTED"

### Rewritten Copy:

**Title**: OPS

**Tagline**: BUILT BY TRADES. FOR TRADES.

**Subtitle**: Job management your crew will actually use.

**Primary Button**: GET STARTED

**Secondary Button**: SIGN IN

**Rationale**:
- Removed comma/line break in tagline for stronger visual impact
- Changed subtitle from process-focused ("Designed in the field") to outcome-focused ("your crew will actually use") - this is the #1 pain point per playbook
- Changed "LOG IN" to "SIGN IN" (more natural, less technical)

---

## 2. USER TYPE SELECTION

**Subtitle (signup)**: "Choose How You'll Use OPS"

---

### JOIN A CREW (Employee/Crew Member Tab)

**Headline**: SEE YOUR JOBS. GET TO WORK.

**Description**: Your schedule, job details, and directions—all in one place. No more calls asking "what's next?"

**Features** (benefit-first, action-oriented):

**Button**: JOIN MY CREW

---

### RUN A CREW (Company Owner/Crew Lead Tab)

- Works offline, syncs later

**Button**: SET UP MY COMPANY

---

**Rationale**:
- Changed "JOIN COMPANY" to "JOIN A CREW" - more authentic trades language per playbook
- Changed "CREATE COMPANY" to "RUN A CREW" - outcome-focused, not setup-focused
- Headlines now address the user's core desire, not describe features
- "SEE YOUR JOBS. GET TO WORK." speaks directly to field worker reality
- "YOUR CREW KNOWS WHAT'S NEXT." solves the #1 pain point (crew calling to ask questions)
- Removed "team" language, replaced with "crew" throughout (playbook guidance)
- Features rewritten as outcomes, not capabilities
- Subtitle simplified from "Choose Your Role To Get Started" to "Pick one to get started." (more direct, less corporate)
- Button copy changed from "JOIN MY TEAM" to "JOIN MY CREW" for consistency

---

- EMAIL
- PASSWORD

**Helper Text**: 8+ characters

**Primary Button**: CREATE ACCOUNT

**Divider**: OR

**Social Buttons**:
- Continue with Google
- Continue with Apple

---

**Rationale**:
- Company subtitle now addresses objections upfront ("Takes 30 seconds. No credit card required.") - reduces friction, sets time expectation
- Changed "team" to "crew" for employee subtitle
- Simplified helper text from "Minimum 8 characters" to "8+ characters" (saves cognitive load)
- Social buttons kept in sentence case for friendlier feel (per research)

---

- "Couldn't connect. Check your signal and try again." (for network errors)
- "Google sign-in unavailable right now." (temporary state)
- "Apple sign-in unavailable right now." (temporary state)

---

**Rationale**:
- Changed "LOG IN" to "SIGN IN" (more natural language)
- Subtitle changed from "Sign In To Your Account" (redundant) to "Welcome back." (warmer, shorter)
- Error messages rewritten to be helpful, not just descriptive
- "Check Your Credentials" is corporate-speak → "Wrong email or password. Try again." is direct

**Avatar Section**:
- Label: ADD PHOTO

---

**Logo Section**:
- Label: COMPANY LOGO
- Helper: Optional

---

**Rationale**:
- Changed subtitle from "Basic Information" (generic) to "This is how you'll appear to your crew." (explains the purpose)
- Changed "Use My Email" / "Use My Phone" to simply "Use mine" (shorter, same meaning)
- "Keyboard Button: Done" removed from copy spec (that's a UI element, not copy)

---

**Rationale**:

- Subtitle changed from "Tell Us About Your Business" to "Quick details to set you up right." (explains why, feels fast)
- Field labels rewritten as questions (more conversational, less form-like)
- "INDUSTRY" → "WHAT DO YOU DO?" (how real people talk)
- "COMPANY SIZE" → "HOW MANY ON YOUR CREW?" (OPS language)
- "COMPANY AGE" → "HOW LONG IN BUSINESS?" (conversational)
- Industry picker renamed to "SELECT YOUR TRADE" (more authentic)

1. Title: "YOUR JOBS" / Description about seeing jobs

3. Title: "BUILT FOR THE FIELD" / Description about testing

**Rewritten Copy**:

**Page 1**:
- Title: YOUR JOBS
- Description: See what's scheduled. Tap for details. Update when done.

**Page 2**:
- Title: WORKS OFFLINE
- Description: No signal? No problem. Syncs when you're back.

**Page 3**:
- Title: READY?
- Description: Your schedule is waiting.

---

**Rationale**:
- Page 1: Shortened to action sequence (see → tap → update)
- Page 2: Conversational tone ("No signal? No problem.")
- Page 3: Changed from "BUILT FOR THE FIELD" (feature) to "READY?" (forward-looking, prompts action). Removed "Tested on old timers" - cute but not valuable at this moment
- All descriptions dramatically shortened—users want to get started, not read

---

### WELCOME GUIDE - Crew Lead Pages

**Current Copy**:
1. Title: "TRACK JOBS" / Description
2. Title: "WORKS ANYWHERE" / Description (long)
3. Title: "TASK-BASED WORKFLOWS" / Screenshots

---

**Rationale**:
- Completely restructured flow to focus on THE FIRST ACTION (creating a job)
- Original had too many features (TASK-BASED WORKFLOWS, JOB BOARD) - overwhelming
- Page 1 now sets immediate expectation and promise ("Takes 30 seconds")
- Page 3 addresses the core value prop: crew sees updates automatically
- Page 4 leads directly into action ("Let's create your first job")
- Screenshot-heavy pages replaced with focused copy - screenshots should support, not dominate

---

### Navigation Buttons

**Current**:
- Next: "NEXT"
- Final: "GET STARTED"

**Rewritten**:
- Next: NEXT
- Final: LET'S GO

---

**Rationale**:
- "GET STARTED" → "LET'S GO" (more energetic, matches earlier "LET'S GO" from company creation screen for consistency)

---
