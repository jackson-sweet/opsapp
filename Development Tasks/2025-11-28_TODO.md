# OPS V2.0.3 Bugs - November 28, 2025

## Task Card Issues
- [ ] Task Card: Need to show CANCELLED overlay (like completed) when job is cancelled (in calendar views and carousel cards)
- [ ] Need to truncate long text on project cards

## Push-In Notification Improvements
- [x] Need to be able to swipe to dismiss the push in notification
- [ ] Should show a progress bar at the very top of screen when it has been dismissed, as sort of a minimized view

## Calendar & Animation
- [ ] Update week view to a more rolling-style animation when swiping left or right to cycle through weeks (too abrupt right now, should slide with finger. Currently no movement on slide gesture, after gesture complete, shows animation)

## Project Status Logic
- [ ] When project is completed, all tasks must automatically be marked completed
- [ ] Need to add 'close job' button on project details view, to change status to closed. Should be in place of 'completed' button, once project status is completed
- [ ] When a new task with status that isn't cancelled or completed is added to a completed project, need to update that project's status to no longer complete
- [ ] If a project is complete, and one of its tasks statuses is changed to booked or in progress, that project's status should be changed to in progress
- [ ] The project.status field needs to be computed based on the statuses of its tasks

## Task Creation & Forms
- [ ] Upon task creation, need to gracefully dismiss the TaskFormSheet, and need to show a success overlay upon successful creation
- [ ] When creating task, scheduler view needs to leave dates empty when user presses 'cancel' (currently defaulting to today's date)

## Task Details View
- [ ] Edit team members in task details view does not work

## Project Details View
- [ ] Team members list in project details view needs to compute the values to show based on project's tasks team
- [ ] Remove edit button/pencil icon in project details view header, and remove 'tap on any field to edit'

## Calendar Events Bug
- [ ] Create project with a task, two events show up on calendar
- [ ] On app launch, new projects not correctly populating calendar, after pressing manual sync button shows up properly

## App Entry & Messaging
- [x] Add a possible message display on app entry, which fetches message from Bubble to display (app update etc)
- [x] Allow to dismiss push in notifications

## Organization Settings
- [ ] Logo uploaded does not show current logo
- [ ] Need to show company code in organization settings

## Team Invites
- [ ] When invite email is sent, need to show a confirmation that it has been sent (InviteTeamSheet)

---

## Completed This Session
- [x] App Message System - fetches and displays messages from Bubble on app launch
- [x] Swipe-up-to-dismiss for push-in notifications
- [x] Tactical loading animation for loading overlay
- [x] Removed notification settings button (until full implementation)
