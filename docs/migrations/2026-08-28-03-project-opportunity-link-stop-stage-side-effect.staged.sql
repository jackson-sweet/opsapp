-- =====================================================================
-- PM MUST APPLY — NOT YET APPLIED TO PROD.
--
-- Apply order: 3 of 3, AFTER the decline columns and the RPC. Apply via
-- MCP `apply_migration` against ijeekuhbatykdomumfjx with migration name:
--     project_opportunity_link_stop_stage_side_effect
-- Then read the stamped version back and mirror into
-- ops-software-bible/migrations/ per that directory's README.
--
-- POST-APPLY VERIFICATION (by object, never by ledger key):
--   1. select pg_get_functiondef(oid) from pg_proc
--       where proname = 'enforce_project_opportunity_link'
--         and pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace;
--      Assert: no `stage = 'won'`; no `insert into public.stage_transitions`;
--      the v_link_contract_mutated permission block intact.
--   2. Behavioural probe in a rolled-back transaction:
--        begin;
--          -- pick any lead-linked project
--          select id, opportunity_ref from projects
--           where opportunity_ref is not null limit 1;
--          update projects set status = 'accepted' where id = <that id>;
--        -- assert the linked opportunity's stage did NOT change and no new
--        -- stage_transitions row appeared, while project_status_lifecycle_outbox
--        -- gained a row (that trigger is separate and untouched).
--        rollback;
--
-- ORDER MATTERS: applying this before the RPC leaves a window in which
-- nothing wins a linked lead at all.
-- =====================================================================
--
-- D3 of ops-software-bible/specs/plans/2026-08-18-lead-project-identity-design.md
-- — bug 9a89b951. The link trigger stops winning the linked lead as a side
-- effect of project status. It keeps enforcing the link contract (mirrors,
-- unlink, permission gates — its legitimate job). Winning now always has a
-- human actor: iOS prompts on entering accepted/in_progress/completed/closed
-- and commits through public.win_linked_opportunity; conversion continues to
-- set 'won' itself inside its own token-guarded transaction and is unaffected.
--
-- Until today the trigger force-won the lead with stage_manually_set = true
-- (a forged manual flag) and a stage_transitions row with transitioned_by
-- null (no actor). That silent win is why declining was impossible.
--
-- The body below is the live 2026-08-28 body with exactly two write-side
-- deletions and nothing else: the four stage-bookkeeping assignments in the
-- final UPDATE, and the trailing stage_transitions INSERT block.
-- v_from_stage / v_stage_entered_at remain declared and selected — plpgsql
-- tolerates the now-unused reads, and this function has had two prior
-- surgeries, so reviewers diff it.
--
-- Rollback: re-apply the body from
-- ops-software-bible/migrations/20260818184224_project_opportunity_link_crew_status_unblock.sql
--
