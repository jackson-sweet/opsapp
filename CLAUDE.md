# OPS Brand Identity Guide

## Brand Essence: Dependable Field Partner

OPS (Operational Project System) exists to make trade workers' lives easier through technology that "just works" in any environment. We serve as the invisible, reliable companion that helps field crews accomplish their work without adding complexity or demanding attention.

## Core Brand Values

1. **Built By Trades, For Trades** - Created by actual trade workers who understand the real challenges of managing projects and crews in the field, not tech people who've "never swung a hammer."

2. **No Unnecessary Complexity** - We don't burden users with features they'll never use or processes that take more time than they save.

3. **Reliability Above All** - In the field, reliability isn't a feature—it's a requirement. OPS works when other technologies fail, maintaining dependability in challenging conditions with poor connectivity.

4. **Field-First Design** - Every aspect of OPS is designed for the realities of job sites, not office environments. We embrace dirt, gloves, sunlight, and noise as the natural working conditions of our users.

5. **Time Is Money** - We respect that every minute spent managing software is a minute not spent on billable work.

4. **Field-Appropriate Confidence** - The quiet confidence of someone who knows what they're talking about
5. **Situational Awareness** - Adjust tone based on context (errors, education, etc.)
