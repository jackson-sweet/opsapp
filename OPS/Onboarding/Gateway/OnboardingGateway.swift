//
//  OnboardingGateway.swift
//  OPS
//
//  Onboarding rebuild P2 — the SwiftUI shell that hosts the rebuilt onboarding
//  flow. It owns a single `OnboardingFlowCoordinator`, maps the live user into
//  the server-state the coordinator derives resume placement from, renders the
//  screen for the current step, and performs the host-level side effects
//  (completion → enter the app, sign-out → real auth signout).
//
//  This file is DEAD until `FeatureFlags.useRebuiltOnboarding` is flipped true
//  AND ContentView routes to it. The default-false flag keeps the legacy flow
//  shipping until cutover.
//
//  SCOPE: as of P3, `.welcome` (S1) and `.rolePick` (S2) render their real,
//  design-system-final screens (`WelcomeStepView` / `RolePickStepView`); every
//  OTHER step still renders the `OnboardingPlaceholderStep` stub — labeled,
//  walkable scaffolding so a debug build can drive the flow end-to-end. The
//  remaining real screens replace those stubs in P3–P5; the §12 design gate
//  applies to the real screens, not to the scaffolding. Do not treat the stub
//  styling as canonical.
