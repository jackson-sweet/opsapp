# Version 2.0.3 - Team Management & Data Sync Improvements
*Release Date: November 13, 2025*

## App Store Summary

**User Interface Updates**
Completed tasks and events now show a grey overlay and "COMPLETED" badge in calendar views and home screen. Job board task deletion now requires confirmation.

**Team Management**
Adding or removing team members from tasks automatically updates the parent project's team. Field crews assigned to any task immediately see that project. Team changes save instantly while syncing in background.

App validates data on launch to prevent sync errors. Subscription and employee seat information syncs correctly. Unseated employees can contact administrators with one tap. Background sync never blocks your work.
