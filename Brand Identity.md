## Content Principles

### 3. Own Problems, Deliver Solutions
- Acknowledge issues directly
- Don't make excuses

## Tone Examples

### DO SAY:
- "No signal? No problem. Changes sync when you're back online."
- "Clear assignments. Zero confusion."
- "Plan your day before the meeting. Not during it."
- "This feature isn't ready yet. We're building it right."

### DON'T SAY:
- "We're excited to announce our revolutionary solution!"
- "Please ensure optimal connectivity for enhanced performance."
- "This amazing feature will transform your workflow!"
- "We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."

## Application Areas

### UI Copy
- Button text: Action-focused ("Update Status" not "Click to Update")
- Error messages: Direct and helpful ("No internet. Working offline." not "Connection error occurred")
- Success states: Brief confirmation ("Status updated." not "Your status has been successfully updated!")

### Marketing Content
- Focus on solving real problems
- Use specific examples from trade work
- Highlight reliability over features
- Speak to results, not process

### Support Content
- Assume user competence
- Provide clear steps
- Don't over-explain obvious actions
- Focus on getting back to work quickly

## Brand Values in Writing

### Simplicity
Strip everything to essential function. If it doesn't help complete the mission, cut it.

### Accountability
Own mistakes. Provide solutions. Move forward. Never blame the user.

### Field-First Design
Every word choice should consider outdoor conditions, time pressure, and practical constraints.

### Reliability
Consistent tone. Dependable information. No surprises or gotchas.

## Tagline Usage

**Primary**: "SIMPLIFY THE MISSION. DELIVER QUALITY. GET IT DONE."
Use sparingly and only when it adds value. Not required on every piece of content.

## Social Media Voice

### Instagram/LinkedIn Posts
- Lead with insight or principle
- Use real examples from field work
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 lines max)
- End with clear takeaway
- Hashtags: #OPSleadership #ExecutionMindset #NoExcuses

### Engagement Responses
- Thank genuine feedback briefly
- Address problems directly
- Share credit for successes
- Redirect criticism toward solutions

## Content Quality Check

Before publishing any content, ask:
1. Would a crew lead respect this message?
2. Does this help someone do their job better?
3. Is every word necessary?
4. Does this sound like it came from someone who's worked in the field?
5. Would Jocko approve of the discipline and directness?

## Remember

We're not building for Silicon Valley. We're building for the people who keep our world running. Every word should honor that mission.
