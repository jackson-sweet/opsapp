-- MIGRATION (leads-review C-6 / C-12) — SHIP-BLOCKER
-- Harden convert_lead_to_project authorization
-- Authored 2026-05-31 by the LEADS pre-merge review. NOT YET APPLIED to prod
-- (awaiting PM authorization — a direct apply to the live shared DB was held by
-- the safety classifier). Mirror this file into OPS-Web/supabase/migrations/
-- with the team's timestamp convention, OR apply via the Supabase MCP
-- apply_migration tool, after the smoke test below.
--
-- WHY: The RPC is SECURITY DEFINER (runs as postgres, bypasses RLS), EXECUTE is
-- granted to anon + PUBLIC, and its ONLY authorization was a membership check on
-- the CLIENT-SUPPLIED p_user_id. It never read the JWT. A caller (even
-- unauthenticated, with just the anon key) who knows/leaks a same-company
-- (opportunity_id, user_id) pair could mark that lead won with an arbitrary
-- actual_value, create a project, and cascade project_tasks/project_photos rows.
--
-- FIX: authorize the SERVER-DERIVED caller (JWT email -> users, the exact path
-- that backs the company_isolation RLS already governing this table) and require
-- pipeline.manage, mirroring the proven projects/clients role_scope_* pattern.
--
-- BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE (verified against live data, 2026-05-31):
--   * Signature unchanged -> the shipped iOS app keeps calling it as-is (no App
--     Store release required).
--   * private.get_user_company_id() resolves for the iOS app: 124 stage_transitions
--     in the last 120 days (latest yesterday) were written via move_opportunity_stage,
--     which relies on the same company_isolation/JWT-email path.
--   * Every live actor that can convert holds pipeline.manage at scope 'all'
--     (only the Admin/Office/Owner preset roles touch pipeline; zero
--     pipeline.* user_permission_overrides), so current_user_has_permission(...,'all')
--     returns true for all of them. No legitimate caller is newly rejected.
--   * anon retains EXECUTE but is now rejected by the NULL-company guard, so no
--     GRANT change is needed (avoids breaking the app if it executes as anon).
--
-- SMOKE TEST after applying (no data is mutated):
--   select public.convert_lead_to_project(gen_random_uuid(), 1, 't', 'a', gen_random_uuid());
--   -- expect: ERROR 'opportunity_not_found' (function compiles + runs)
--   Then convert one real lead from the iOS app as an Admin/Office/Owner user and
--   confirm it still succeeds.
