-- PM MUST APPLY — NOT YET APPLIED TO PROD.
--
-- Apply order: 2 of 3. Apply via MCP `apply_migration` against
-- ijeekuhbatykdomumfjx with migration name:
--     win_linked_opportunity_rpc
-- Then read the stamped version back and mirror into
-- ops-software-bible/migrations/ per that directory's README.

-- D3 of ops-software-bible/specs/plans/2026-08-18-lead-project-identity-design.md
-- — bug 9a89b951. The one deliberate door around the client's `.won`
-- rejection in OpportunityRepository.validateDirectStageMutation: that
-- guard exists because winning an UNLINKED lead mints a won-without-
-- project orphan. This RPC re-verifies the link under a row lock, so it
-- structurally cannot do that, and it stamps the human actor into
-- stage_transitions — which is the whole point of D3.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER: RLS `role_scope_update` on opportunities is
-- private.current_user_can_edit_opportunity(id) for both USING and
-- CHECK, so a caller who may not edit this lead selects nothing here and
-- gets opportunity_not_found. Nothing below uses auth.uid(), which is
-- unusable under the Firebase JWT bridge.
