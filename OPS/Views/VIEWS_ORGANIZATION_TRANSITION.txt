# Project Organization Transition Guide

## Summary of Changes

We've reorganized the project files to improve maintainability and code organization. The new structure organizes components by their functionality and scope, making it easier to find and work with related files.

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Related components are now grouped together
2. **Reduced Folder Clutter**: The Components folder is now logically subdivided
3. **Better Contextual Organization**: Components are now organized by their domain (Project, User, Map, etc.)
4. **View-Specific Components**: Each main view now has its own Components folder for view-specific UI elements
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: The new structure makes component relationships more explicit

## Implementation Strategy

To minimize disruption, we recommend implementing this reorganization in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Set Up New Structure (Current)
- Create new directories
- Add README and organization documentation
- Prepare transition plan

### Phase 2: Move Files (Next Sprint)
- Move files in logical groups, starting with the least dependent components
- Update imports as files are moved
- Test compilation after each group move

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Following Sprint)
- Remove empty directories
- Update build configurations if needed
- Ensure documentation is complete

## How This Affects Your Work

### For Developers
- When editing moved files, check the REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md to find their new location
- Follow the new organization guidelines when adding new components
- Use relative imports to reference components in the new structure

### For Code Reviewers
- Ensure new files follow the organization guidelines
- Verify imports are properly updated in PRs that modify moved files

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues with the reorganization or have questions about where to place new components, refer to:

1. The README.md in the Views folder
2. The REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md for the complete folder structure
3. Ask for guidance in the #dev-ios Slack channel

## Next Steps

Once the reorganization is complete, we'll continue refining our architecture with:

1. Better separation of view models and views
2. More consistent state management patterns
3. Improved testing structure for UI components
